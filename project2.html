            <h2>How I changed it & why I did it that way</h2>
            <p>In the frontpage the pictures was just hardcoded in two columns and three rows. Insted of displaying all of them in onw time I made a carousel for the pictures. When the user clicks back and fourth, one and one picture will appear. I did this in javascript in a slight different way than the carousel for the exam. It is a similar method, but in another way. Both ways are done with setting a px that slides left of right when the user clicks. The click event is inside a forEach function, so that every time the buttons are clicked the same function excecutes. Inside that there is an if else statement that desides whether you are going back or fourth. I think having a carousel instead of all the images at once, makes it easier for the user to take in all of the images. They can focuse on each picture to really understand what the site is about. Also it looks more proffessional. I also added a on hover effect on the next and back button, so increase user experience. </p>
            <p>At the page, exhibition spaces, I added a "load more posts" button. By default there are three posts and when you click the two last appears. I did that to make it a little more fun for the user. Even though there are only five posts, the user can be involved in the page. Since it was not made with an API I had to take the content out of the html page and put it in the javascript page. I made it an array, and then displayed it in html in kind of the same way as an API, through a loop. Since there were only a few posts, I used "slice" to slice the array at three posts. When button is clicked the whole array is shown, and button is disabled. Button disabled when the whole array is displayed is good user experience. </p>
            <p>At the visit page I had just a printscreen of a google maps. If the user want to click, drag and look at the map that is not good for the user experience. So I went to google maps, searched for the location I wanted and exctracted the iframe for that view. I copied that in in the html and had to do some css to make it responsive. Now the user can use the map, as they would use the google map anywhere. </p>
            <p>Feedback from tutor was that the underlinde under the current page in nav bar was not easy to see at last draft. So now I made the underline thicker, so that the user can see it more easily. </p>
            <p>I also got feedback that the colours I had chosen at the last submission was not of good contrast. I changed the colour on the footer and on the buttons. I checked the new colours in Googles extension WCAG Colour contrast checker. The button inthe footer have now good contrast is all different colour blindness and can be easily spotted if you are visually impaired aswell.</p>
