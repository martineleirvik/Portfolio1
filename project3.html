            <h2>What was changed</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Contact form</li>
                <li>Search through blogposts</li>
                <li>Design on blogspesific.html</li>
                <li>Change of javascript method for the show more button</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why I did it that way & How I changed it</h2>
            <p>The form only had a simple validation, so even if it passed validation, the users inputs was still displayed on the form and not resetting. In javascript I added true or false statements to the validation function. And when submitting, if the all the inputs are true it passes validation, the form will reset. And I also added a message when the form is submitted with innerHTML. I did it that way so the user understands that the inputs were valid and everything went fine. When it resets and a message appears, the user can understand that the form is sendt and valid. </p>
