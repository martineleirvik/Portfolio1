            <h2>What was changed</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Contact form</li>
                <li>Search through blogposts</li>
                <li>Design on blogspesific.html</li>
                <li>Change of javascript method for the show more button</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why I did it that way & how I changed it</h2>
            <p>The form only had a simple validation, so even if it passed validation, the users inputs was still displayed on the form and not resetting. In javascript I added true or false statements to the validation function. And when submitting, if the all the inputs are true it passes validation, the form will reset. And I also added a message when the form is submitted with innerHTML. The same was as Project 1. I did it that way so the user understands that the inputs were valid, sendt and everything went fine. When it resets and a message appears, it increases the user excperience. </p>
            <p>The search function was done with javascript. It started similar to fetching all the blogposts. I also exported and imported the looping and innerHTML from blogpost.js into search.js, so I did not have to do it twice. Then I made an onSubmit function that took care of the search value and then used that in the funcation that filtered content by search term. If it was a match the blogposts returns true, if not it returns false and nothing will appread. I also made the button "show more blogposts" disabled when the user searched. That for making a better user experience, so the user wont wonder if it is supposed to be clicked, and then nothing happens.  </p>
            <p>I changes the design on the blogspesific.html page a little bit, so it looks a but smoother. The blogpost was before inside a solid line, which did not look very neat, so i vhanged it to be inside a box shadow instead. In this page I also added a "back to all blogposts" so the user dont need to click on the navigation each time. I thought that made a better user experience. </p>
